The data is from the FFIEC Home Mortgage disclosure Act((https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-publication/snapshot-national-loan-level-dataset). We first conduct different comparison analysis based on race, age, and other demographic info. Then brings in K-means clustering to subgroup applicants. T-test, Linear Model and Logit Model are also applied on the analysis.
